# DS_Spotify_Recommendations
The Spotify Recommendations project is a data-driven exploration leveraging the Spotify API to gather information about top tracks and artists. The project encompasses data analysis, visualization, and the creation of a personalized recommendations engine. It begins by fetching data on popular tracks from the API and extracting features such as artist popularity, genre distribution, and audio characteristics. The data is then visualized using techniques like radar charts and heatmaps to highlight correlations and trends. The project also showcases a recommendation system that generates personalized music suggestions based on user-defined seed artists, genres, and tracks. Overall, the project offers a holistic view of music data, from top tracks and artist insights to interactive visualizations and personalized recommendations.
